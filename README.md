# Accelerated Introduction to Computational Biology for Biologists: Part 2
Part 2 of the "Accelerated intro to Computational Biology for Biologists" course for the Master's Programme in Computational Biology, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. This covers the first 2 weeks (~24 hours) of material, taught by Mark Wilkinson. 

In this part of the course we cover:

   * Introduction to Docker
   * Introduction to Databases (mySQL), including Docker installation
